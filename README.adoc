Various utilities related to publishing documents in various formats: AsciiDoc, DocBook, HTML, XML.

This library focuses on code and API quality, not on performance. Please open an issue if this creates a problem for any of your use cases.
I will make reasonable efforts to respond promptly and fix bugs (or at least document them).

The API is _not_ stable. Please contact me if you are interested in using this library and wonder about stabilizing its API, or if you would like more example code.

== Use
I recommend using the XALAN or SAXON factory; the JDK embedded one fails on multiple DocBook stylesheets.
