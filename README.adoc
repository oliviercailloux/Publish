This library focuses on code and API quality, not on performance. Open an issue if this creates a problem for some of your use cases.

This project adheres to the https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph/blob/master/Zero-Bugs-Commitment.md[Zero Bugs Commitment].

The API is _not_ stable. Write to me if you are interested in using this library and wonder about stabilizing its API, or want more example code.
